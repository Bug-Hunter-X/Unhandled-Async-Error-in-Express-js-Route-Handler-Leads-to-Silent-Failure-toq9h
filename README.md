# Unhandled Async Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Node.js Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous route handlers that prevent the server from sending a proper response to the client, leading to silent failures.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js app with a route handler that performs an asynchronous operation. If this operation throws an error, the error is caught, but the application fails to send a response to the client. This results in the client experiencing a timeout or never receiving a response.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle such errors.  The solution ensures that a response is always sent to the client, regardless of whether the asynchronous operation succeeds or fails.  This prevents silent failures and improves the overall reliability of the application.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Make several requests to the server (e.g., using `curl` or a browser).  Observe that some requests may result in no response.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`.
6. Repeat step 4.  Notice that now, all requests will receive a response, either successful or indicating an error.

## Key Learning
Always ensure that your asynchronous route handlers in Express.js (or similar frameworks) send a response to the client, whether the operation succeeds or fails.  Failing to do so will lead to unreliable applications that silently fail to respond to legitimate requests.
